\section{Our Approach}
Our approach exploits structural information like \FB \CVT tables to  automatically annotate event mentions\footnote{An event mention is a
phrase or sentence within which an event is described, including its type and arguments.} in order to generate training data to learn an
event extractor. Such an approach is known as Distant Supervision (\DS)\FIXME{~\cite{}}. Essentially, we use the knowledge extracted from a
known knowledge base to label sentences from another dataset to generate training data.


We use the arguments of a \CVT table entry to infer what event a sentence is likely to express. A \CVT table entry can have multiple
arguments but not all of the arguments are useful in annotation. For example, the \texttt{divisions\_formed} argument in
Figure~\ref{fig:example} (b) is not as important as the other three arguments when determining if a sentence expresses a
\texttt{business.acquisition} event. Therefore, our first step is to identify the key arguments from a \CVT table entry. A key argument is
an argument that plays an important role in one event, which helps to distinguish with other events. If a sentence contains all key
arguments of an entry in an event table (e.g. a \CVT table), it is likely to express the event expressed by the table entry. If a sentence
is labelled as an event mention of a \CVT event, we also record the words or phrases that match the entryâ€™s properties as the involved
arguments, with the roles specified by their corresponding property names. For instance, sentence S1 shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example} (a)
is a mention of \texttt{business.acquisition} type, its involved arguments are ``Remedy Corp", ``BMC Software", and ``2004", and the roles
of the three arguments are \texttt{company\_acquired}, \texttt{acquiring\_company} and \texttt{date} respectively.

\subsection{Determining Key Arguments}
We use the following formula to calculate the importance value, $I_{cvt, arg}$ of an argument \emph{arg} (e.g., date) to its event type
\emph{cvt} (e.g., \texttt{business.acquisition}):

\begin{equation}
	I_{cvt, arg} = log \frac{count(cvt, arg)}{count(cvt) \times count(arg)}
\end{equation}


where $count(cvt)$ is the number of instances of type $cvt$ in a \CVT table, $count(arg)$ is the number of times $arg$ appearing in all
\CVT types, and $count(cvt, arg)$ is the number of $cvt$ instances that contain $arg$.
