Event extraction, %which detects the occurrence of events with specific types and extract arguments (i.e. typed participants or
%attributes) that are associated with an event, is an important technique that
which underpins many natural language processing applications,
has long been investigated in a supervised learning paradigm.% is an effective method for building event extraction systems.
The effectiveness of event extractors is bound by the number and the quality of  the training instances. Existing  training data must be
manually generated through a combination of expert domain knowledge and extensive human involvement. However, due to drastic efforts
required in annotating text, the resulted datasets are usually small, which severally affects the quality of the learned model, making it
hard to generalize.

Our work develops an automatic approach for generating training data for event extraction, and allows us to construct training data with
hundreds of thousands of instances, at a much lower cost than a manual approach. We achieve this by employing distant supervision to
automatically create event annotations from unlabelled text using existing structured knowledge bases or tables. We then develop a neural
network model with post inference to transfer the knowledge extracted from structured knowledge bases to automatically annotate typed
events with corresponding  arguments in text. We evaluate our approach by using the knowledge extracted from Freebase to label texts from
Wikipedia articles. Experimental results show that our approach can generate a large number of high-quality training instances. We show
that this large volume of training data not only leads to a better event extractor, but also allows us to detect multi-typed events -- a
feature that none of the existing event extractors can offer.


%Supervised learning is an effective method for building event extraction systems. The effectiveness of the learning is bound by the
%number and the quality of  the training instances. Existing event extractor systems are typically built upon expert-annotated datasets.
%However, due to drastic efforts involved in annotating text, these datasets are usually small and cover only a limited variety of event
%types. In this paper, we investigate ways to generate training datasets that require little expert involvement but can cover a richer set
%of event types. We achieve this by employing distant supervision to automatically create event annotations from unlabelled text using
%existing structured knowledge bases or tables. We then develop a novel neural network model with post inference, to detect multi-typed
%event mentions \FIXME{ZW: reviewers may not know what is a event mention} with corresponding arguments. Experiments on the datasets
%collected through Freebase and Wikipedia tables show that it is possible to learn to extract events of rich types without human-annotated
%training data. \FIXME{ZW: Will come back to the experimental results later.}

%Existing event extraction systems are typically investigated in a supervised learning paradigm, which heavily relies on the quality of
%expert-annotated datasets. Due to the drastic efforts involved in text annotation, the human-annotated datasets are typically small, only
%covering a limited variety of event types. This limits This limits the quality of learned event extractor, making it hard to generalize.


%In this paper, we address the problem of automatically building event extractors for rich event types with little expert involvement. We
%achieve this by employing distant supervision to automatically create event annotations from unlabelled text using structured knowledge
%bases or tables. We propose a novel neural network model with post inference, to detect multi-typed event mentions with corresponding
%arguments.

%We first propose four hypotheses based on our observation and produce our dataset accordingly. Then,
%We further propose a novel neural network with ILP-based post inference, committing to
%handling two challenges in event extraction: multi-type events and multi-word arguments.
%Both automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to learn to extract various  events, according to existing knowledge bases, without human-annotated training data.
